# Home-Sales-SQL

In this task, I utilized my understanding of SparkSQL to analyze crucial metrics from home sales data. I employed Spark to establish temporary views, segment the data, and manage caching and uncaching of a temporary table. Additionally, I confirmed the table was successfully uncached. This work was conducted on Google Colab.
